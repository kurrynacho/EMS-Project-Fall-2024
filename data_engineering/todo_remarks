Dear Jessica, Karina, Darius:


Thanks to all for your hard work. I won't engage in mea culpas, but mea culpa.

JM's to do's; some may not be done by Monday and obviously there will be no time to process remediated data.
1. Jessica alerted us to counties absent from some datasets, in particularly her list of ~30 counties that she submitted to us recently.
	a. One reason may be that my dropbox ran out of space, and my output files were stuck in an intermediate stage of upload; that is fixed now.
	b. Another reason may be that there will be more counties tabulated in 2023 than 2018.
	c. Counties may have been merged or dropped since 2018.
	d. I owe you a systematic summarization and tabulation of (a-c).
2. Darius recently alerted us to missing dates. I can think of several potential reasons for missing dates:
	a. The date is referred to by a PcrKey, but there were one or more null values in the linked files or their entries.
		+ solution may be to impute.
	b. The date is missing from the source file for no systematic reason (missing by chance);
		+ here the solution may again be to impute.
	c. Maybe most concerning:
		(i) the density of entries for some tims/date interval is low and absent dates are expected.
			+ in this case, nothing wrong with the data, and it should be possible to use the data directly, e.g. "0" for all categories for that date.
		(ii) dates have been merged for technical reasons.
			+ solution may be to randomly split the data for the merged dates;
	
Even if the problems have not been solved by Tuesday, at least we can provide a "to-do" list.
